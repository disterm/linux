# TermCord
Have you ever wanted to see and make messages without even being on Discord? Get TermCord, the easy-to-use terminal "app" made to make your life a little bit easier. With it being light-weight and fast, it can connect in seconds! Most of all, it even supports user tokens, aswell as bot tokens!

## Install
- Go [here](https://github.com/sharknix/termcord-linux/releases/latest) and download the ``TermCord.zip`` file included.
- Extract the .zip file, then "``cd``" over to the TermCord folder.
- Make the scripts needed to open TermCord runnable by using these 2 commands: ``chmod +x main.sh``, ``chmod +x client.js``.
- And finally, run it by opening the main file with the command ``./main.sh``.
- If the last step didnt work, try running the command with root access: ``sudo ./main.sh``.

## Usage
Put in a user/bot token, and your in!
Just use it like normal discord. Chat and talk with friends, and more :smile:
