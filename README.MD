# TermCord
Imagine a way to use Discord in your terminal; Get TermCord.

## Install
- Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/sharknix/termcord-linux/releases/latest) and download the ``TermCord.zip`` file included.
- Extract it, and "``cd``" over to the TermCord folder
- Do these 2 scripts to make TermCord runnable: ``chmod +x main.sh``, ``chmod +x client.js``
- Do the final command, ``./main.sh``

## Usage
Put in a (bot) token, and your in!
Just use it like normal discord. Chat and talk with friends, and more :smile:
