# Node Modules
These are the node modules required.

- Discord.js
- colors (will be using soon)
- Moment (for time)
- emojic(for the connected text)
- node-emoji (For getting emojis into the terminal)

## Why are the modules not here?
There not here because GitHub just doesnt allow me to add the folders.
