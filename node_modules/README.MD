# Node Modules
These are the node modules required.

- Discord.js
- colors (will be using soon)
- Moment (for time)
- emojic(for the connected text)
- node-emoji (For getting emojis into the terminal)

## Why are the modules not here?
There not here because GitHub just doesnt allow me to add the folders.

## Install Packages
To install all of them in a simple script, just use this command:
``npm i discord.js colors moment emojic node-emoji``

## Support
If you have a problem with node.js or npm, I reccomend going either [here](https://github.com/nodejs/help) for node.js, or [here](https://www.npmjs.com/support) for npm.
You also could hop over to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and get answers.
